Active CTF player with a passion for cryptography based challenges. Not the best Cryptographer in the world but I enjoy the challenges.

This site is my attempt to document and explain my approach to some of the cryptography challenges from various CTF events. Hopefully the detailed descriptions might help some other CTF players in their attempts to solve some challenges.
